python is simple,easy and portable.
python is free and open sourse.
python is high level ,interpreted language.
python was developed by Guido van Rosume.
python is interpreted language means when we werite python code its executed the code line by line  thats why we called python
it is a interpreted language.
print is function to give output statement in python ,so print is output function .

character set of python languade-
latter= A-Z,a-z
digites =0-9
special character= - ,+,/,* etc
white space= blank space,tab,new line

what is variable in python - a variable is a name given to a memory location in a program or else we can simply say variable is a container store some data.
character set of python 
1. rules for identifiers-name of the variables.
2. identifiers can be combination of uppercases and lower case latter ,digits or an underscore (_) ex-_myvariable,_variable1
3. an identifier can not start with digit ,so while variable is valid but 1variable is not valid.
4. we can use special special character or symbols like #,@,*  etc
5. identifier can be of any length.
6. variable name should be small and meainful like -when we give  our  age in that csae we take variable as "my age".
myAge-camel case latter.
'type' is a operator to show datatype name in our variable like which datatype we use. 

DATA TYPES-
mainly data types of 5 typesin python.
these datatypes are unmutable or build in data types.
1.integer-+ve value,-ve value
2-string- character 
3-float- 3.44,5.99
4-boolean- true,false
5-none-not assign

COMMENT LINE
when we write some code but we dont want to execute it the we give the comment line to that place so that te line of code not executed.
1 single comment line- it uses "#" symbol
# this line is a comment
# this is a comment
2 multi line comment-
it  is written as """_""".
ex-multi line
comments 
"""
types of operator=
simpley we can say operator is a symbol that perform a certain operation between operants.
ex-a+b
a,b-are two operants
+,-> operator
there are 4 types of perator 
1.arithmetic operator(+,-,/,%,*)
2 relational operator -(==,<,>)
3 assignment operator-(=,<=,>=)
4 logical operator -(and,or not)


input in python=
input()statement is used to accept value.that value entered from the keybord by the user.


STRING=
string is a data type that store sequence of character.
str1="this is a good day"
str2='this is a good day'
str3="""this boy is bad"""
all this string are real string because in python,it supports all these syntax.
-\n(new line)-it is used to break the line .it break the line automatically
Bsic operation in string-
1.concatenation->
"hellow"+"world"=
2.length of string->
len(str)

INDEXING 0F STRING=
-webbocket-012345678(indexing)
-indexing start from zero(0)



SLICING OF STRING=
- accessing parts of a string .
- endind index is not counting.
- syntax- str[strting_index:ending_index]
str="webbocket"

str[0:3] #web
str[:3] web
str[3:] bocket

FUNCTION OF STRING=
ex-="i am an coder"
1. str.endwidth("er.")-return true if string ends with substring
2.str.capitalize()=return 1st char is capital
3.str.replace(old,new)=replace all occurance of old with new
4. str.find(word)=return 1st index of 1st occurance
5.str.count("am")=count the occurance of substring in string

CONDITIONAL STATEMENT-
-use to handel the codition in your program.
-syntax=(if-elif-else)
-elif means else if

if(condition):
statement1
elif(condition):
statement2
else:
statenemt(defult)

LISTS IN PYTHON=
-LIST IS A builtin data type that store set of values
-it can store elements of diffreent typrs like-integer,float,string
-in list we can make indexing
-in list we can find the length of the list also.
-in list we can also do the sclicing.
ex-
marks=[54,55,78]-aeeay of list
student=["hitesh",66,"bbsr"]-list

LIST IN SLICING=
-it similar to string sclicing
-syntax-list name[starting_idx: ending_idx]
-ending index is not inciuded.
marks=[23,25,67,78,98]
marks[1:4]->[25,67,78]
marks[:3]=[23,25,67]
marks[2:]=[67,78,98]

LIST METHODS=
list=[9,4,7,8,1]
list.append(6)-adds one elements at the end of the list-[9,4,7,8,1,6]
list.sort()-sort the element in asscending order-[1,4,7,8,9]
list.sort(reverse=True)-sort the element in decending order-[9,8,7,4,1]
list.reverse()-reverse the list-[1,8,7,4,9]
list.insert(idx,el)-insert the element at index
list.remove(1)-remove the 1st occurance of element-[9,7,8,1]
list.pop(idx)-remove element at index

Git=
git is a open sourse repository system where we can save,manipulate,colaborate,our code with any one else
-in our software era every one can use git system for their soft ware development.
-we also called git is a version control system
-git provides some tool to use their funtionality ex-github,gitlab...etc
